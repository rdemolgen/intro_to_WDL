# Intro to WDL

Work through each section in the following order:
1. hello_world
2. inputs_outputs
3. compound_types
4. alias
5. conditionals_optionals
6. docker
7. scatter_gather

Use Cromwell or miniwdl to run these workflows locally.
Some tasks/workflows will contain bugs which you will need to troubleshoot and fix :)
